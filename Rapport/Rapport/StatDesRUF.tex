    \item pop :total population, in thousands
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{"diamonds"} : A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. The variables are as follows :
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item price : price in US dollars (\$326?\$18,823)
    \item carat : weight of the diamond (0.2?5.01)
    \item cut : quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
    \item color : diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
    \item clarity : a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF (best))
    \item x : length in mm (0?10.74)
    \item y : width in mm (0?58.9)
    \item z : depth in mm (0?31.8)
    \item depth : total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43?79)
    \item table : width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43?95)
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{"world2"} : This is an alternative version of the world database based on latitudes [0, 360), which then has the Pacific Ocean in the centre of the map.\newline
  The data file is merely a character string which specifies the name of an environment variable which contains the base location of the binary files used by the map drawing functions. This environment variable (R\_MAP\_DATA\_DIR\_WORLD for the datasets in the maps package) is set at package load time if it does not already exist. Hence setting the environment variable before loading the package can override the default location of the binary datasets.
  \item \textit{lung} : Survival in patients with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Performance scores rate how well the patient can perform usual daily activities.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item inst: Institution code
    \item time: Survival time in days
    \item status: censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
    \item age:  Age in years
    \item sex:  Male=1 Female=2
    \item ph.ecog:  ECOG performance score (0=good 5=dead)
    \item ph.karno: Karnofsky performance score (bad=0-good=100) rated by physician
    \item pat.karno:  Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient
    \item meal.cal: Calories consumed at meals
    \item wt.loss:  Weight loss in last six months
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{mtcars} : The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973?74 models).
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item mpg Miles/(US) gallon
    \item cyl Number of cylinders
    \item disp  Displacement (cu.in.)
    \item hp  Gross horsepower
    \item drat  Rear axle ratio
    \item wt  Weight (1000 lbs)
    \item qsec  1/4 mile time
    \item vs  V/S
    \item am  Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
    \item gear  Number of forward gears
    \item carb  Number of carburetors
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{mpg :} This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data that the EPA makes available on \href{http://fueleconomy.gov}{fueleconomy.gov}. It contains only models which had a new release every year between 1999 and 2008 - this was used as a proxy for the popularity of the car.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item manufacturer : manufacturer name
    \item model : model name
    \item displ : engine displacement, in litres
    \item year : year of manufacture
    \item cyl : number of cylinders
    \item trans : type of transmission
    \item drv : f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
    \item cty : city miles per gallon
    \item hwy : highway miles per gallon
    \item fl : fuel type
    \item class : "type" of car
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{iris } : This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. iris is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species.\newline
  iris3 gives the same data arranged as a 3-dimensional array of size 50 by 4 by 3, as represented by S-PLUS. The first dimension gives the case number within the species subsample, the second the measurements with names Sepal L., Sepal W., Petal L., and Petal W., and the third the species.
  \item \textit{faithful : } Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item eruptions numeric Eruption time in mins
    \item waiting numeric Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
